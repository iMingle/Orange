/**
 * The {@code SymbolDigraph} class represents a digraph, where the
 * vertex names are arbitrary strings.
 * By providing mappings between string vertex names and integers,
 * it serves as a wrapper around the
 * {@link Digraph} data type, which assumes the vertex names are integers
 * between 0 and <em>V</em> - 1.
 * It also supports initializing a symbol digraph from a file.
 * <p>
 * This implementation uses a {@link Digraph} to store the underlying graph.
 * The <em>indexOf</em> and <em>contains</em> operations take time
 * proportional to log <em>V</em>, where <em>V</em> is the number of vertices.
 * The <em>nameOf</em> operation takes constant time.
